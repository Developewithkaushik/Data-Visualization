## 1. Cross-Platform Customer Behavior & Churn Analysis

##### 'Cross-Platform Customer Behavior & Churn Analysis' project! Used Python for robust data cleaning & feature engineering, then built a dynamic Power BI dashboard to visualize key banking customer churn drivers. This showcases skills in data transformation, DAX, and interactive reporting for strategic business insights. Project limitation: Current analysis primarily leverages demographic data due to public dataset constraints. Future enhancements will integrate actual transactional data to uncover more nuanced behavioral patterns predicting churn, enabling richer, proactive retention strategies
